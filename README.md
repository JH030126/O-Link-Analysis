In this repository you can find the R script used for analysis of O-Link Proteomics data from peripheral blood samples of human cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors or combination treatment. This work was for my MSci Honours Project Report - James Hamilton (University of Glasgow, Scotland). 

This repository was created for the purpose of markers of my honours project report who can see the code used to execute the workflow described in the methods section of my report.
